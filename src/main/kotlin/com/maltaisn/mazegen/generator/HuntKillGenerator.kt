/**
 * Implementation of the hunt-and-kill algorithm for maze generation as described
 * [here](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/24/maze-generation-hunt-and-kill-algorithm).
 *
 * 1. Make the initial cell the current cell and mark it as visited.
 * 2. Kill: Randomly connect the current cell with an unvisited neighbor, changing the
 *          current cell to the neighbor, until there are no more unvisited neighbors.
 * 3. Hunt: Find a visited cell with an unvisited neighbor. Make it the current cell.
 *          If there's none, the maze is done.
 *
 * Generated mazes are very similar to those generated by the recursive backtracker,
 * because the only difference in the algorithm is that instead of backtracking, it
 * chooses a cell at random from those already visited. That also makes it much slower.
 *
 * This implementation is actually different than most hunt-and-kill implementations
 * because instead of finding an unvisited cell next to a visited cells, it does the
 * opposite, and randomly. As a result, it's faster but also produces results more
 * similar to the recursive backtracker.
 *
 * Runtime complexity is O(n) and memory space is O(n).
 * A traditional implementation would have complexity of O(nÂ²) and memory space of O(1).
