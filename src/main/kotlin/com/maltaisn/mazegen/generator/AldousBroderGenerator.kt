/**
 * Implementation of Aldous-Broder's algorithm as described
 * [here](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/17/maze-generation-aldous-broder-algorithm).
 *
 * 1. Make the initial cell the current cell and mark it as visited.
 * 2. Choose a random neighbor. If the neighbor wasn't visited before:
 *     - Connect it with current cell.
 *     - Mark it as visited.
 *     - Make it the current cell.
 * 3. Repeat step 2 until set is empty.
 *
 * Generated mazes are uniform, meaning all possible mazes are generated
 * with equal probability. However this comes at the cost of efficiency,
 * which is very low, because each cell can be visited many times.
 * The algorithm has to find all the unvisited cells by walking randomly.
 *
 * Runtime complexity is O(n) at best and O(âˆž) at worst. Memory space is O(1).
